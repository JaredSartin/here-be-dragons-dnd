We are a group of artists, actors, storytellers, and nerds. Our passion for
art, storytelling, and adventuring manifests itself in Dungeons & Dragons. We
bring our adventures and collaborations online for you to experience with us.
Our community is important to us, check us out in the links below. 

Join us twice a month for our adventure that follows 4 unique characters as they
try to solve, fight, and dig their way out of situations the DM throws their
way. Watch us live on our [Twitch page](https://twitch.tv/HereBeDragonsDnD)
every 1st and 3rd Saturday of the month at 4pm PST.
